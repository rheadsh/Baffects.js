# Baffects.js
Baffects.js is a library adaptation of the Processing language in JavaScript for Adobe After Effects. It allows for most of the functionality included in Processing to be used natively in After Effects, plus a custom workflow to enhance productivity.

To create new sketches:
Duplicate the file in 'baffectsjs/scketches/template.jsx' to be able to run your sketches in After Effects.

To run sketches:
1. Download Adobe ExtendScript Toolkit and press play button or from the menu Debug - Run.
2. In After Effects go to the menu File - Scripts - Run Script File...

## Visual Studio Code workflow
Visual Studio Code can use the following extensions to make it easier to run and debug scripts: 
1. Adobe Script Runner (on windows machines you have to update After Effects path for CC 2020)
2. ExtendScript Debuggger


IMPORTANT NOTE:
Currently only the english version is fully supported because of properties name conventions inside After Effects.
